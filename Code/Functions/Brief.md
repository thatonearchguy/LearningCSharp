# Exercises - Functions

Write **quiet** functions, with suitably meaningful names, that:

1) Sum two integers together
   1) Write a different one with the same name that does the same for doubles
2) Calculates the sum of the individual digits of a given integer
   
3) Takes an integer and returns a boolean - true if the input was prime, and false otherwise
   
4) Takes a string and counts the number of spaces in the string
   
5) swaps the values of two integer numbers (hint: by value vs by reference, use the ref or out keyword)
   
6) Return a string that has the binary and hex representation of the input value.
