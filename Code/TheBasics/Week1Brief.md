# Introductory Exercises for C#
1) Write a program that takes in two numbers representing minutes and seconds taken to run a 10km race.  Output the runner’s speed in m/s and mph (miles per hour). 
   - Google the conversion factor between km and miles. 
   - Extension: handle a user not inputting a number gracefully - e.g. exception handling or TryParse
2) Ask for an integer, write out the multiplication table for that value (i.e. up to 12)
    - Can you format it such that the units/tens/hundred line up neatly, i.e. right-justified 
    - Extension: ask for a second number, which is the number of rows to output in the table (i.e. to change the default of 12). 
3) Ask the user for a radius length, output the circle’s area and circumference to 2 decimal places.
    - Consider the precision of Pi. Investigate to see if there’s an inbuilt method of avoiding your having to type in. 
    - Extension: ask the user which value (r, a, c) you’re going to input, then output the other two values. 
4) Extension1: offer the user a menu to decide which of questions 1-3 to run, loop until the user chooses to leave 
5) Extension2: abstract your code into functions
