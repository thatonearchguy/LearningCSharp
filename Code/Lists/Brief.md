# Exercises - Lists
There were more exercises than this, but I had lost them as I was transferring data to a new machine... Here are the ones I did:

1) Search a sorted list (without using built in functions)
   - Implement a “naive” search, which just loops over the list and returns true if the given item is in the list 
   - Create a binary search function (as opposed to a linear search function) to return a bool to answer if a given item is in the list.

From this point on, you can use whatever methods you like.
 
2) Given an unsorted list of signed integers, return a list of all the integers that are duplicated in the list. 
3) Building on Q2, build a function that takes two lists and returns a Boolean if one list is a subset of the other list
4) Reverse a list, in-place.
5) We will, later in the course, be discussing sorting in much greater detail.  
   - But for now, implement a sort algorithm, you can use wikipedia: 
(not Bubble), although insertion or selection are ok
   - But quick, shell, merge or something with average complexity better than O(n2) would be better
