# Encryption - Theory

This folder contains implementations of the Caesar, Vignere and RSA ciphers from the theory side of the A-Level course. Feel free to use these as you wish.
- Caesar and Vignere currently support alphabetic characters only but you may mix capitalisation
- RSA only realistically supports uppercase characters due to limitations on my own skill and with ASCII representations of characters since the lowercase characters go into 3 digits making it impossible to split the number back into the original string. 
  - This could probably be fixed by changing the representation from ASCII to unicode which can have a fixed length which wouldn't be affected by the various calculations. 
- If you have any suggestions feel free to make a pull request or issue.
