# Exercises - Iteration

1) Write a (non-quiet) function timesTable(i, m) that accepts an integer and prints out the first m multiples of that number (nicely formatted).
   - Extension: re-write your answer to question 1 using this new function 
2) Write a function Ask10(n) to ask the user for n numbers and output the total and the average of the numbers input. (This function is also not quiet.) 
3) Write a function Triangular(n) which returns the nth triangular number
triangular(3) == 6 
triangular(12) == 78
4) Please write (in C#) your answer to the 2003 Q1 BIO question - ISBN - https://www.olympiad.org.uk/papers/2003/bio/round_one.html
5) Sesame Street’s Count von Count tweets out his latest number once a day, starting with “One! Ah! Ah! Ah!” “Two! Ah! Ah! Ah!“ Just how high can Count von Count can count? Write a function: int CountVonCount(boolean ands, boolean commas, boolean oldTwitter, boolean valediction) which takes whether you should include commas or not, and "ands" or not, also whether he’s a purist (140 characters) or happy with the new limit (280 characters) and whether he includes the valedictory “Ah! Ah! Ah!” at the end. 
i.e. "one thousand, five hundred and seventy two" could be "one thousand five hundred seventy two" if ands, commas and ahs are ignored. 
Don't forget to include the exclamation mark at the end.
6) When you move the final digit of 142857 to the front, you get 714285, which is five times as large. What is the smallest positive integer that is doubled when the last digit moves to the front?
7) If you finish - and have adequately tested your functions - please write (in C#) your answer to the 2003 Q3 BIO question - New Order - https://www.olympiad.org.uk/papers/2003/bio/round_one.html
