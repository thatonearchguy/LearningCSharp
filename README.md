# Learning C#

This repository contains all the code that I will have written as part of my A-Level Computer Science course in C#. I will continually update this as I keep learning new material and skills, and complete new exercises to use those skills.

## How to run this code?
In the event you actually want to try this code for yourself, feel free to download it and import it into your IDE - I'm using VSCode on Linux but it should work with Visual Studio or any other IDE with C# support. 

Here's a rundown of the structure:
- The `Code` directory contains all the code I have written
- The `Testing` directory contains all the tests for the programs in the `Code` directory.
